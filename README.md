# Map-Gen

## This is intended as a tool for testing and visualizing:
* Procedural Map Gen Algorithms
* Pathfinding Algorithms


### Progress
#### Map Generation
* [x] Cellular Automata
* [ ] Simple Rooms
* [ ] BSP Rooms
* [ ] Drunkard's Walk
* [ ] Diffusion Aggregation
* [ ] Voronoi Diagrams
* [ ] Perlin/Simplex Noise

Note: A checkbox does not indicate customizable, simply that it is an enabled option to test with defaults. Once all features are fully customizable this note will disappear.

#### Pathfinding
* [x] Depth First Search
* [x] Breadth First Search
* [x] Dijkstra
* [x] A-Star
